## PROJECT 1 : The Process of Discovering the Higgs Boson Particule
The Higgs boson machine-learning challenge aims to explore the potential of advanced machine-learning methods to improve the analysis of data produced by the experiment. This project relies on high dimensional data and targets the creation of a binary classifier that classifies events as an observation of the decay of the Higgs particle into two tau particles.
